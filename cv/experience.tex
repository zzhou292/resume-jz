		\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
			\item {Advisor: Professor Dan Negrut.}
			\item {Developed autonomous vehicle coordination and simulation, leveraged simulation fidelity and real-time performance for Human-In-The-Loop, Hardware-In-The-Loop and Software-In-The-Loop applications. Head developer of chrono::HIL, a plug-in of Project Chrono (\url{https://projectchrono.org/}) to provide human-in-the-loop and real-time simulation support for traffic scenarios and vehicle dynamics. chrono:HIL provides flexible simulator hardware coupling capabilities, distributed simulation support, soft real-time simulation support, and multiple vehicle dynamic models. Integrated Chrono::HIL with National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS) at the University of Iowa.} 
			\item {Integrated sensor (lidar/radar/camera sensor) simulation using chrono::sensor into traffic scenarios to assist the development of autonomous vehicle control and sensor fusion. Provided simulation support for human-factor research conducted by Cognitive Systems Laboratory at UW-Madison. Funded by National Science Foundation OAC2209791.}
			\item {Involved in the development of Gym-Chrono, a Deep Reinforcement Learning environment and pipeline using Project Chrono to enable research on the transfer of learned policy from simulation to reality.}
			\item {Extraterrestrial rover and robot mechanical component simulation. Applications/development/validation of SCM (Soil Contact Model), SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics), and DEM (Discrete Element Method) deformable terrain. Developed the VIPER lunar rover model and the Curiosity Mars rover model in the chrono::robot module. Integrated sensor simulation support to provide Lidar/Radar perception data in harsh lunar environment. Funded under NASA project to support 2023 VIPER lunar mission.}
