I’m a simulation engineer double‑major in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin Madison. My research focuses on the development and validation of digital twins and their applications in control designs of robotic systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructures. My research experiences allow me to develop strong programming capabilities, knowledge in high‑performance computing, deep understandings in multi‑body dynamics and physics simulation, and computer graphics.I am currently an active member of Simulation-Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an active developer of open-source multi-physics simulation engine Project Chrono.\\
