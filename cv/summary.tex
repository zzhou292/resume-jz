I'm an experienced C++ and Python software engineer with a focus on the design and programming in high-performance simulation software, robotics control, and embedded systems. I am working on my PhD while double‑majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. My research focuses on the development and validation of digital twins and their applications in the design of autonomy control stacks for robotic systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure. My research experiences have allowed me to develop strong programming skills, knowledge in high‑performance computing, deep understandings in multi‑body dynamics and physics simulation, and computer graphics. I am a member of the Simulation-Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) at the University of Wisconsin--Madison, and an active developer of the open-source multi-physics simulation engine Project Chrono.\\
